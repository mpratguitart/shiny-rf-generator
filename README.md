# RF Generator (v2.0)

An RShiny application for generating **Response Functions (RFs)** that describe how wildfire and forest management treatments affect habitat components for wildlife species. Built by [Vibrant Planet Open Science](https://github.com/Vibrant-Planet-Open-Science).

> ⚠️ **Status: Active development.** This is v2.0, currently being rebuilt from v1. The UI skeleton is working, real data wiring and RF computation are in progress. Not production-ready — see [Current scope & limitations](#current-scope--limitations).

---

## What it does

RF Generator lets a user define an area of interest, pick the ecosystem components (ECs) that matter for a given species or habitat concern, set importance weights and effect types, and get back a weighted Response Function describing how different wildfire intensities and management treatments affect habitat suitability over time.

Outputs feed into:
- Quantitative Wildfire Risk Assessments (QWRA)
- NEPA analyses
- Species at Risk Assessment workshops

v2.0 replaces the v1 fixed-slider approach with the manuscript-aligned method: separated importance weights (1–5), explicit effect types (positive / negative / range), and a richer set of exposed ECs.

## Who it's for

Wildlife biologists, fire ecologists, HVRA workshop participants, and analysts working on forest management and wildfire risk planning. Some familiarity with the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) outputs is helpful but not required.

## Current scope & limitations

**In scope (v2.0 initial release):**
- Western US, California (CA) and Central Rockies (CR) FVS variants
- Fire intensity classes FIC1–6
- Stand-level and species-specific RFs

**Not yet wired (in progress):**
- Treatments: MRCT (ground-based mechanical thin), MTTH (manual thinning), RMGP (grapple pile burn) — needs `compute_te_rf()` with base year 2030
- EC search box: text input exists on the EC picker screen but doesn't filter the list yet
- Species-specific ECs: LiveTpa/LiveBA per species not yet added to the EC picker when the "Individual tree species" path is selected

**Out of scope this release:**
- Additional treatments (CMCC, CMUR, HCTA, HERB, MTIR, MTUR, REVA, RMMA, RMTF, RXAI, RXGF)
- Modular `ui.R` / `server.R` / `global.R` restructure
- Arrow/Parquet conversion of the large RDS files
- Library submission flow

**Known issues:**
- Large AOIs (multi-state) may time out; ecoregion-scale AOIs are the expected upper bound

## Quick start

### Prerequisites
- R ≥ 4.3 (renv.lock currently pins R 4.5.3)
- No AWS credentials needed — the `vp-open-science` bucket is public and the app uses anonymous S3 access
- R package dependencies: pinned in `renv.lock`. After cloning, run `renv::restore()` to install — see [Reproducible environment](#reproducible-environment-renv) below.

### Run
```r
# From the repo root
shiny::runApp("R")
```

The app opens in your default browser at `http://127.0.0.1:NNNN`.


## Reproducible environment (renv)

This project uses [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) to pin R package versions for reproducibility. Exact versions used by the app are recorded in `renv.lock`.

**First time pulling this branch or cloning the repo:**

```r
renv::restore()
```

This installs the pinned packages into a project-local library (`renv/library/`). Expect 5–10 minutes on first run — `sf` and `terra` are slowest because of their geospatial system library dependencies. Subsequent R sessions in the project auto-activate `renv`.

**Adding a new package:**

```r
renv::install("pkgname")   # install into project library
renv::snapshot()            # record the new version in renv.lock
```

Then commit the updated `renv.lock` with your change.

**Troubleshooting:** If `renv::restore()` fails on `sf`, `terra`, or another spatial package, confirm you have Rtools installed (Windows) or GDAL/PROJ/GEOS system libraries (macOS/Linux).

## Data

The app pulls precomputed FVS outputs from S3:

```
s3://vp-open-science/biodiversity/habitat-suitability/response_function_data/conus/v0.0.0/
```

Primary files used:
- `CA-ALL-StandLevel_2024-12-18.rds` — California variant, all scenarios
- `CR-ALL-StandLevel_2024-12-18.rds` — Central Rockies variant, all scenarios
- `CA-FIC-StdStk_*.rds`, `CR-TRT-StdStk_*.rds` — species-level stock tables
- `rshiny-spatial-data/` — county-level TreeMap ID lookups, western counties gpkg

## RF computation

Uses the "revised difference in proportion" formula from the data prep notebooks:

```
rf = (metric[t] / metric[t=0]) - (base[t] / base[t=0])
```

- Clipped to [-1, 1]
- BASE joined to FIC scenarios on `(StandID, Year)` — calendar year alignment, not rel.time
- Fire base year = 2035
- See `docs/timing_assumptions.md` for full timing conventions

## Wizard flow

1. **AOI** — upload a `.gpkg` boundary file or select ecoregions on the map
2. **Filters** — narrow stands by forest type and structural class (O'Hara 1996)
3. **Review** — confirm AOI, variant, and matching stand count before loading
4. **RF type** — pick stand-characteristics path or tree-species path
5. **Species** *(species path only)* — select target tree species (filtered to LiveTpa > 5 at fire year)
6. **ECs** — pick ecosystem components grouped by subcategory (canopy, tree size, fuels, wildlife habitat, carbon, growth)
7. **Weights** — set importance (1–5) and effect type (positive / negative / range) per EC
8. **Download** — review RF outputs, EC config, and fact sheet; download as CSV + markdown bundle

## Development

### Branching
- `main` — most recent working state
